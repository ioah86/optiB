\section{Matchins, Stable Sets, Vertex Covers and Edge Covers}

\begin{def}
Let $G = (V, E)$ be an undirected graph. A \emph{matching} (Paarung) is a
subset $M \subset E$ such that $e \cap e' = \emptyset \forall e, e' \in M$
with $e \neq e'$.

A matching $M$ is called \emph{perfect} if all vertices are incident to
some edge in $M$.
\end{def}

\begin{ex+}
An airline has to allocate two pilots to each of the (round)trips on a
single day. Only certain pairs of pilots can work together, due to
experience, qualification, location, etc. By defining a graph with vertex
set the pilots and edges if two pilots can work together, a daily
corresponds to a matching since a pilot can work at two trips at the same
time.
\end{ex+}

\begin{def}
A matching $M \subseteq E$ is called \emph{maximal} if no further edges can
be added.

A \emph{maximum} matching is a matching $M$ with maximal cardinality, i.e.
no other matching $M'$ exists with $|M'| > |M|$.

$\nu(G) =$ \emph{matching number}, size of a maximum matching.
\end{def}

\subsection{Further related graph parameters}
$\alpha(G) = $ Stable set number / independent set number (Stabile-Mange-Zahl), size of a maximum stable set in
$G$: a subset $S \subseteq V$ such that $\forall_{\{v, w\} \in E} \left|
\{v, w\} \cap S \right| \leq 1$

$\rho(G) = $ Edge cover number (Kanten√ºberdeckungszahl), minimum size of an
edge cover of $G$: a subset $F \subseteq E$ such that $\forall v \in V:
\exists e \in E: e = \{ v, w \}$.
