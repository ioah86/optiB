\section*{Menger's Theorem}

\begin{defn}
Let $D = (V, A)$ be a digraph and $S, T$ subsets of $V$.
A path is called a $S-T$-path, if the start vertex is in $S$ and the end
vertex is in $T$.

If $S = \{s\}$ and $T = \{t\}$ we also refer to the path as $s-t$-path
instead of $\{s\}-\{t\}$-path-
\end{defn}
